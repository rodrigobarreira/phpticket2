ticket-0915-test 20060328 "SinnerGuarida" Release
=====

* Removed paramater $page on functions03.inc:: function show_action_data($id,$table,$page,$start_id=0)
* Clean up PHP-parser errors and warnings
* Moved "<hr>" in config.php from right after "if ($_SESSION['ticket_user_is_admin']>1){...}" to inside the curly brackets
* #0049 : Not a bug. I'm just paranoid.
* #0050:    Alan K Eng - Vocom  <aleng@vocom.com> has found the bug as well. Hoping he might find the problem and help to fix it!
	Also, clicking on page >[2]  (say, [3] or greater), returns page with no tickets!
	Tried this: In functions02.inc::list_data(), replaced:
		$SQL = $SQL . " AND  $status " . $unassigned;
		$SQL = $SQL . " AND  $status ";
	with:
		$SQL = $isclosed . $SQL . " AND  $status " . $unassigned;
		$SQL = $isclosed . $SQL . " AND  $status ";
	Doesn't work:
		An error occured in function "functions02.inc::list_data()::mysql_query()": 
		"mysql query failed with query_max SELECT `id` FROM `ticket` closed=true& WHERE 1 AND `severity` >=0 AND `status` = 2 "
* #0050. I figured out what the problem is:
	When clicking any page number ([2], [3], [4]...), the next page does
	not know that it has to show only "closed tickets", thus it mixes up
	closed and open tickets.
	
	The solution would be to find a way to pass the "we are listing
	closed-only tickets" to the listing function
	(functions2.inc::list_data()) and to the page indexing function
	(functions01.inc::index_elements()).
	
	In top.php , the links to CLOSED add "showclosed=true". Let's make this a parameter to add to URLs.
		- Added new parameter to functions01.inc::index_elements()  -> $isclosed=""
		- On functions02.inc::list_data() , added   if ($_GET['showclosed'] == 'true') ... $isclosed = "&showclosed=true";
		  and then, whenever there is a call for sort , added ".$isclosed" to the URL
		- On functions01.inc::index_elements() , added    if ($isclosed != "") ... $url_addon = "&showclosed=true";
		  and then, whenever there is a URL, added  ".$url_addon"
		  
	This makes indexing work with closed tickets. Closing bug.

ticket-0914-test 20060120 "Vuelve La Tira" Release
=====

* Fixed bug. Line 632 of functions03.inc::edit_option() was
	print '<BR><BR><FORM METHOD="post" ACTION="'.$GLOBALS['SECOND_PAGE'].'.php?id='.$option_id.'&action=delet&go=1">' / "\n \n";
  ... resulting in a "divide by zero" when trying to remove an action. Now te line is:
  	print '<BR><BR><FORM METHOD="post" ACTION="'.$GLOBALS['SECOND_PAGE'].'.php?id='.$option_id.'&action=delet&go=1">' . "\n \n";
  Backported to -official version.
* Globaly replaced $_SESSION['username'] with $_SESSION['ticket_username']
* Globaly replaced $_SESSION['user_is_admin'] with $_SESSION['ticket_user_is_admin']
* Redoing search.php to:
	better parametize file
	search in actions
	add backticks to table fields in SQL querys
* search.php . This line MUST have single quotes around  $_POST[frm_query] or query will fail.
	$search_fields .= "`".$field2search[1]."` REGEXP '$_POST[frm_query]' OR ";
* Bug #0047:  In functions02.inc::add_element_buttons() , it said "access2pacs_user_is_admin" instead of "ticket_user_is_admin".
* Removed parameter $page from functions01.inc::show_simple_data()
* Corrected warnings on  functions01.inc's functions. Warnings b/c parameters received by function were not "used" except... 
	... to directly print something. Added a bunch of " if ($parameter == "") { $error } "
* Bug #0048. To solve it,  replaced in search.php line: 
		get_option_owner("user", $_SESSION['ticket_username']); // , $index);
	with line:
		get_option_owner( get_id_from_user($_SESSION['ticket_username'])); // , $index);

* BUG #0042:
	Tried to prevent Login TimeOut using function  session_cache_expire(). 
	session_cache_expire() gets rid of the session expiration issue[*] . The 
	problem is that STABLE's version of PHP does not implement this core 
	function.  session_cache_expire() works with PHP 4 >= 4.2.0. STABLE uses 
	PHP-4.1.2 
	[*] After $PHP_DEFAULT_VARIABLE minutes of inactivity on a PHP application, 
	your session will end. If there is information being sent, say, a new action, 
	this information gets lost because the session identifier used by the current 
	page has expired. 	
* BUG #0043:
	If Description field has text with double-quotes, on closing ticket, text gets cut on first double-quote.

* Fixing  BUG #0039: functions01.inc::get_option_owner() was expecting 2 parameter: $table and $current_value. 
	First parameter was never used, as "$table" is hard-coded in the code. 
	Then, on functions02.inc::build_edit_form(), the parameters passed were ($current_value, $tab_index).  This was bad and caused the problem.
	Removing parameter $table on functions01.inc::get_option_owner() , and testing if it breaks something else. 
	* Backporting to 0910.
* Fuxed bug #0040: 
	Problem with how headers get dealt with in HTML. Corrected with if($update == update) {send_headers() } else { son_not_sent_headers}
